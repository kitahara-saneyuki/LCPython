# Amazon Leadership Principles 亚马逊领导力准则

Leadership Principles，也就是领导力准则，不仅仅是几条用来鼓舞人心的口号，更是成就了Amazon特有公司文化的秘诀。不管是为新项目讨论创意、寻找解决客户问题的方案，还是面试求职者时，它都是Amazon员工的重要参考标准和行为准则。

## 1. Customer Obsession 顾客至尚

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.
领导者从客户入手，再反向推动工作。他们努力工作，赢得并维系客户对他们的信任。虽然领导者会关注竞争对手，但是他们更关注客户 。

## 2. Ownership 主人翁精神

Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job".
领导者是主人翁。他们会从长远考虑，不会为了短期业绩而牺牲长期价值。他们不仅仅代表自己的团队，而且代表整个公司行事。他们绝不会说“那不是我的工作”。

## 3. Invent and Simplify 创新简化

Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.
领导者期望并要求自己的团队进行创新和发明，并始终寻求使工作简化的方法。他们了解外界动态，四处寻找新的创意，并且不局限于“非我发明”的观念。当我们开展新事物时，我们要接受被长期误解的可能。

## 4. Are Right, A Lot 决策正确

Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.
领导者在大多数情况下都能做出正确的决定。他们拥有卓越的业务判断能力和敏锐的直觉。他们寻求多样的视角，并挑战自己的观念。

## 5. Learn and Be Curious 好奇求知

Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.
领导者从不停止学习，并不断寻找机会以提升自己。领导者对各种可能性充满好奇并付于行动加以探索。

## 6. Hire and Develop the Best 选贤育能

Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.
领导者不断提升招聘和晋升员工的标准。他们表彰杰出的人才，并乐于在组织中通过轮岗磨砺他们。领导者培养领导人才，他们严肃地对待自己育才树人的职责。领导者从员工角度出发，创建职业发展机制。

## 7. Insist on the Highest Standards 最高标准

Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.
领导者有着近乎严苛的高标准 — 这些标准在很多人看来可能高得不可理喻。领导者不断提高标准，激励自己的团队提供优质产品、服务和流程。领导者会确保任何问题不会蔓延，及时彻底解决问题并确保问题不再出现。

## 8. Think Big 远见卓识

Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
局限性思考只能带来局限性的结果。领导者大胆提出并阐明大局策略，由此激发良好的成果。他们从不同角度考虑问题，并广泛寻找服务客户的方式。

## 9. Bias for Action 崇尚行动

Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.
速度对业务影响至关重要。很多决策和行动都可以改变，因此不需要进行过于广泛的推敲。我们提倡在深思熟虑前提下进行冒险。

## 10. Frugality 勤俭节约

Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size or fixed expense.
力争以更少的投入实现更大的产出。勤俭节约可以让我们开动脑筋、自给自足并不断创新。增加人力、预算以及固定支出并不会为你赢得额外加分。

## 11. Earn Trust 赢得信任

Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
领导者专注倾听，坦诚沟通，尊重他人。领导者敢于自我批评，即便这样做会令自己尴尬或难堪。他们并不认为自己或其团队总是对的。领导者会以最佳领导者和团队为标准来要求自己及其团队。

## 12. Dive Deep 刨根问底

Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.
领导者深入各个环节，随时掌控细节，经常进行审核，当数据与传闻不一致时持有怀疑态度。领导者不会遗漏任何工作。

## 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit 敢于谏言，服从大局

Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.
领导者必须要能够不卑不亢地质疑他们无法苟同的决策，哪怕这样做让人心烦意乱，精疲力尽。领导者要信念坚定，矢志不移。他们不会为了保持一团和气而屈就妥协。一旦做出决定，他们就会全身心地致力于实现目标。

## 14. Deliver Results 达成业绩

Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.
领导者会关注其业务的关键决定条件，确保工作质量并及时完成。尽管遭受挫折，领导者依然勇于面对挑战，从不气馁。
